**THEORY:**

When the projectors (ex: line of sight of humans) from the source are parallel to each other and perpendicular to the plane of the object, for example a person looking at building, then the projection is called as an **Orthographic Projection**.

**Isometric projections** enable an object to be viewed in three dimensions in a single view, from which the actual sizes can be measured.
<br>

Every point and every line in an orthographic view has a meaning. A point may represent a **corner** or an **edge**. A line may represent an **edge** or a **surface**. The meaning of each point or line should be interpreted by systematically referring back
and forth from one view to the other. Simultaneously, the shape of the object as a whole should be visualized.
<br>

The most convenient method of drawing the isometric view of any solid object is the boxing method.Â  
<br>In this method, the object is considered to be
placed in a rectangular box having dimensions with maximum dimensions of
the object along the three axes. 
<br>The edges of the rectangular box are
the isometric axes and the surfaces of the rectangular box are the
isometric planes.

The four basic steps for creating an isometric drawing are:

1.  Positioning the object. Determine the isometric viewpoint that
    depicts maximum features of the object

2.  Once the object is positioned and the viewpoint is decided, draw the
    isometric axes which will produce that view-point.

3.  Construct isometric planes, using the overall width (W), height (H),
    and depth (D) of the object, such that the object will be enclosed
    in a box.

4.  Locate details on the isometric planes. Darken all visible lines,
    and eliminate hidden lines unless necessary to describe the object.
